# nodejs-simple-chat
Its a simple Node.js chat application. Messages will be delivered in real-time and we are going to take advantage of the Speech Synthesis API for the supporting browsers so that the computer can read aloud the messages as they arrive in the chat. We will be using Node.js, Express and Redis for persistence.
